# Servers


## Community instances

NeoDB is not a single website. To use it, you need to sign up on an instance, that lets you connect with other people using NeoDB across Fediverse and Bluesky.

{servers}

JSON version of this list is also available [here](servers.json). If you are hosting a public instance of NeoDB and wish to share that with the community, please [edit this file](https://github.com/neodb-social/neodb-doc/edit/main/docs/servers.json) and submit a pull request.

To host your own instance of NeoDB, see [installation guide](install.md).


## Public relay hosted by NeoDB developers

 - `relay.neodb.net` - NeoDB instances may connect to this relay to send and receive public posts, this is to help share items, ratings and reviews in the network, more on this in [configuration doc](configuration.md).


## Honorable mention
 - [NiceDB](https://nicedb.org) - the original instance, no longer open for registration.
